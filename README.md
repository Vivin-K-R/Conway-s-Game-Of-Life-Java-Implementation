# Conway's Game of Life (Java)

This is a simple Java Swing implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

## How to run

- Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed.
- Can use editors like VS code or IntelliJ IDEA.
  
## How it works

- It is a zero player game, so it starts with a random state (**alive** or **dead**) for each cell.
- A 40x40 grid of cells is displayed.
- Each cell is either alive (black) or dead (white).
- The grid updates every 1 second based on the Game of Life rules.

## Rules of the Game

- A live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies.
- A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive.
- A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.
